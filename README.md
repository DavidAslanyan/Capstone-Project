## 🐳 Docker Setup

You can easily run the ITalk Backend using Docker.

### 1. Build and Run with Docker

Make sure you have Docker installed, then run:

```bash
docker build -t italk-backend .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env italk-backend
```

This will start the server at http://localhost:3000

## 🐳 Docker Setup with `docker-compose`

The following `docker-compose.yml` file is used to set up the **ITalk Backend** along with **PostgreSQL**. This setup creates two services: `solaris-api` (the backend) and `postgres` (the database), running in a **bridge network**.

### `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  # Backend Service (ITalk API)
  solaris-api:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    restart: always  # Ensures the service restarts automatically
    depends_on:
      - postgres  # Ensures PostgreSQL starts before the backend
    env_file:
      - .env  # Load environment variables from .env file
    ports:
      - "${APP_PORT}:3000"  # Maps container port 3000 to APP_PORT
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/src/app  # Mounts the current directory to the container for live reloading
      - /usr/src/app/node_modules  # Prevents overwriting of node_modules on host
    command: npm run start:dev  # Command to start the app in development mode
    networks:
      - myapp-network  # Connects the container to the bridge network
  
  # PostgreSQL Service
  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest  # Uses the latest PostgreSQL image
    restart: always  # Ensures the service restarts automatically
    ports:
      - "5436:5432"  # Maps container port 5432 (default PostgreSQL) to port 5436 on host
    env_file:
      - .env  # Loads environment variables from the .env file (e.g., database credentials)
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data  # Persists PostgreSQL data in a named volume
    networks:
      - myapp-network  # Connects PostgreSQL to the bridge network
  
networks:
  # Custom bridge network for inter-service communication
  myapp-network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  # Persistent volume for PostgreSQL data
